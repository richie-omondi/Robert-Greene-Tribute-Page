            <p2>Robert Greene is an American author and public speaker, best known for his books on strategy, power, and seduction. His bestseller books include <strong>‘The 48 Laws of Power,’ ‘The Art of Seduction,’ and ‘Mastery.’</strong> Born and raised in a middle-class Jew family of California, he studied at the ‘University of California’ and ‘University of Wisconsin’ to obtain a degree in classical studies. From menial work to working as a writer in Hollywood, he did various jobs. A meeting with book-packager Joost Elffers led to the publication of his first book, which proved a bestseller. His books are known for apt quotations. His writing commands a wide array of followers ranging from businessmen, prison inmates, war historians to musicians of show-business. However, his writing has also drawn criticism for being Machiavellian and unethical. After achieving success, he has worked as a consultant to many influential people in business and arts, but at the same time, he has also refused a lot of consultancy work, because only people with fascinating life stories interest him.</p2>
